#  building a classifier using the full Cats v Dogs dataset of 25k images.
### code will run successfully on google colab , you must change some parts if you will run it on other platforms 

assignment of week 1 Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow on coursera
this dataset from kaggle 

there is two files -> one using CNN without data augmentation and this led to clear overfitting during training 
so i edit this algorithm using data augmentation to avoid overfitting
